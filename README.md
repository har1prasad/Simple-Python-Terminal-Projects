# Simple Python Terminal Projects
This repository contains a collection of simple terminal projects created using Python. These projects were developed to reinforce basic programming concepts through practical application. Each project is straightforward and designed to run in the terminal.

### Projects Included

1. **Calculator**: Perform basic arithmetic operations.
2. **RPC**: Rock, Paper, Scissors game.
3. **Number Guessing**: A number guessing game.
4. **Higher Lower**: A game to guess which number is higher or lower.
5. **Hangman**: The classic word guessing game.

8. **Silent Bidding**: A silent auction bidding system.
9. **Calculator Dictionary**: A calculator using a dictionary for operations.
10. **Blackjack House**: A simple implementation of the Blackjack game. [demands proper understanding of logic, problem solving and core concepts of programming]
11. **Simple quiz**: A simple implementation of a quiz using OOP concepts

### Purpose
These projects were developed as part of my learning journey to gain hands-on experience with Python programming. Feel free to explore, use, and modify the code. Note that I haven't provided detailed documentation or extensive comments for all the code, as these projects are relatively simple and intended for my practice and understanding without comprehensive commenting. This will probably help improve both my and your debugging and programming understanding skills.
